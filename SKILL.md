# Emblem Agent Wallet

Connect to EmblemVault's Hustle AI for autonomous wallet management across 7 blockchain networks with 256+ trading tools.

---

## Installation

Install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @emblemvault/agentwallet
```

This provides three commands:
- `emblem-hustle` - Chat with Hustle AI
- `emblem-resume` - Resume with conversation context
- `emblem-reset` - Clear conversation history

---

## How Authentication Works

**Login and signup are the same action.** There is no separate registration step.

| Scenario | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| **First time with a password** | A new vault is created with unique wallet addresses |
| **Same password again** | Returns the same vault (deterministic) |
| **Different password** | Creates a completely different vault |

**Important:**
- Password must be at least 16 characters
- Password = Identity (treat it like a private key)
- No recovery option if password is lost
- No email, no browser, no 2FA - just the password

---

## Credential Discovery

Before making requests, locate the password using this priority:

### 1. Environment Variable (Preferred)
```bash
if [ -n "$EMBLEM_PASSWORD" ]; then
  PASSWORD="$EMBLEM_PASSWORD"
fi
```

### 2. User Home File
```bash
if [ -z "$PASSWORD" ] && [ -f ~/.emblem-vault ]; then
  PASSWORD=$(cat ~/.emblem-vault)
fi
```

### 3. No Credentials Found

Ask the user:
> "I need your EmblemVault password to connect to Hustle AI. This password must be at least 16 characters.
>
> **Note:** If this is your first time, entering a new password will create a new wallet. If you've used this before, use the same password to access your existing wallet.
>
> Would you like to provide a password?"

Once provided, save it:
```bash
echo "USER_PROVIDED_PASSWORD" > ~/.emblem-vault
chmod 600 ~/.emblem-vault
```

---

## Important: Execution Rules

**DO NOT impose timeouts.** Hustle AI queries can take up to 2 minutes. This is normal behavior, not a stall.

**DO NOT assume Hustle is stalled.** Wait for the response to complete naturally.

**Cleanup before next request.** Ensure no leftover emblem-hustle processes are running before starting a new query:
```bash
pkill -f emblem-hustle 2>/dev/null || true
```

---

## Usage

### Chat with Hustle AI

```bash
emblem-hustle -p "$PASSWORD" -m "Your message here"
```

### Resume Conversation with Context

```bash
emblem-resume -p "$PASSWORD" -m "Follow-up message"
```

### Reset Conversation History

```bash
emblem-reset
```

---

## Example Queries

### Check Wallet Addresses (First Thing to Do)
```bash
emblem-hustle -p "$PASSWORD" -m "What are my wallet addresses?"
```

### Check Balances
```bash
emblem-hustle -p "$PASSWORD" -m "Show all my balances across all chains"
```

### Swap Tokens
```bash
emblem-hustle -p "$PASSWORD" -m "Swap $20 worth of SOL to USDC"
```

### Get Market Data
```bash
emblem-hustle -p "$PASSWORD" -m "What's trending on Solana right now?"
```

### Transfer Tokens
```bash
emblem-hustle -p "$PASSWORD" -m "Send 0.1 ETH to 0x..."
```

---

## Communication Style

**CRITICAL: Use verbose, natural language.**

Hustle AI interprets terse commands as "$0" transactions. Always explain your intent in full sentences.

| ❌ Bad (terse) | ✅ Good (verbose) |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `"SOL balance"` | `"What is my current SOL balance on Solana?"` |
| `"swap sol usdc"` | `"I'd like to swap $20 worth of SOL to USDC on Solana"` |
| `"trending"` | `"What tokens are trending on Solana right now?"` |

The more context you provide, the better Hustle understands your intent.

---

## Capabilities

Hustle AI provides access to:

| Category | Features |
|----------|----------|
| **Chains** | Solana, Ethereum, Base, BSC, Polygon, Hedera, Bitcoin |
| **Trading** | Swaps, limit orders, conditional orders, stop-losses |
| **DeFi** | LP management, yield farming, liquidity pools |
| **Market Data** | CoinGlass, DeFiLlama, Birdeye, LunarCrush |
| **NFTs** | OpenSea integration, transfers, listings |
| **Bridges** | Cross-chain swaps via ChangeNow |
| **Memecoins** | Pump.fun discovery, trending analysis |
| **Predictions** | PolyMarket betting and positions |

---

## Wallet Addresses

Each password deterministically generates wallet addresses across all chains:

| Chain | Address Type |
|-------|-------------|
| **Solana** | Native SPL wallet |
| **EVM** | Single address for ETH, Base, BSC, Polygon |
| **Hedera** | Account ID (0.0.XXXXXXX) |
| **Bitcoin** | Taproot, SegWit, and Legacy addresses |

Ask Hustle: `"What are my wallet addresses?"` to retrieve all addresses.

---

## Conversation Persistence

The CLI maintains conversation history:
- History persists across sessions
- Hustle has context from previous messages
- Auto-prunes to last 50 messages

Use `emblem-resume` to show recent context before continuing.

---

## Security

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Password = Identity** | Each password generates a unique, deterministic vault |
| **No Recovery** | Passwords cannot be recovered if lost |
| **Vault Isolation** | Different passwords = completely separate wallets |
| **Fresh Auth** | New JWT token generated on every request |

**Never share your password. Treat it like a private key.**

---

## OpenClaw Configuration (Optional)

Configure credentials in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "entries": {
      "emblem-wallet": {
        "enabled": true,
        "apiKey": "your-secure-password-min-16-chars"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This injects the password as `$EMBLEM_PASSWORD` environment variable.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `emblem-hustle: command not found` | Run: `npm install -g @emblemvault/agentwallet` |
| `Authentication failed` | Check password is 16+ characters |
| `Empty response` | Retry - Hustle AI may be temporarily unavailable |
| `HTTP 401` | JWT expired, will auto-refresh on next request |
| **Slow response** | Normal - queries can take up to 2 minutes |

---

## Quick Reference

```bash
# First time? Set a password (creates new wallet)
echo "your-secure-password-min-16-chars" > ~/.emblem-vault

# Returning? Use same password to access existing wallet
emblem-hustle -p "$(cat ~/.emblem-vault)" -m "What are my balances?"

# Or use environment variable
export EMBLEM_PASSWORD="your-secure-password-min-16-chars"
emblem-hustle -p "$EMBLEM_PASSWORD" -m "What tokens do I have?"
```
