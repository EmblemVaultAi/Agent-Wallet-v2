# Emblem Agent Wallet

Connect to **Agent Hustle** -- EmblemVault's autonomous crypto AI with 250+ trading tools across 7 blockchains. Browser auth, streaming responses, plugin system, and zero-config agent mode.

**Requires the CLI**: `npm install -g @emblemvault/agentwallet`

---

## Quick Start -- How to Use This Skill

**Step 1: Install the CLI**

```bash
npm install -g @emblemvault/agentwallet
```

This provides a single command: `emblemai`

**Step 2: Use it**

When this skill loads, you can ask Agent Hustle anything about crypto:

- "What are my wallet addresses?"
- "Show my balances across all chains"
- "What's trending on Solana?"
- "Swap $20 of SOL to USDC"
- "Send 0.1 ETH to 0x..."

**To invoke this skill, say things like:**
- "Use my Emblem wallet to check balances"
- "Ask Agent Hustle what tokens I have"
- "Connect to EmblemVault"
- "Check my crypto portfolio"

All requests are routed through `emblemai` under the hood.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0
- **Terminal** with 256-color support (iTerm2, Kitty, Windows Terminal, or any xterm-compatible terminal)
- **Optional**: [glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow) for rich markdown rendering (`brew install glow` on macOS)

## Installation

### From npm (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @emblemvault/agentwallet
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EmblemCompany/EmblemAi-AgentWallet-Plugins.git
cd EmblemAi-AgentWallet-Plugins/cli
npm install
npm link   # makes `emblemai` available globally
```

## First Run

1. Install: `npm install -g @emblemvault/agentwallet`
2. Run: `emblemai`
3. Authenticate in the browser (or enter a password if prompted)
4. Check `/plugins` to see which plugins loaded
5. Type `/help` to see all commands
6. Try: "What are my wallet addresses?" to verify authentication

---

## Authentication

EmblemAI v3 supports two authentication methods: **browser auth** for interactive use and **password auth** for agent/scripted use.

### Browser Auth (Interactive Mode)

When you run `emblemai` without `-p`, the CLI:

1. Checks `~/.emblemai/session.json` for a saved session
2. If a valid (non-expired) session exists, restores it instantly -- no login needed
3. If no session, starts a local server on `127.0.0.1:18247` and opens your browser
4. You authenticate via the EmblemVault auth modal in the browser
5. The session JWT is captured, saved to disk, and the CLI proceeds
6. If the browser can't open, the URL is printed for manual copy-paste
7. If authentication times out (5 minutes), falls back to a password prompt

### Password Auth (Agent Mode)

**Login and signup are the same action.** The first use of a password creates a vault; subsequent uses return the same vault. Different passwords produce different wallets.

In agent mode, if no password is provided, a secure random password is auto-generated and stored encrypted via dotenvx. Agent mode works out of the box with no manual setup.

### What Happens on Authentication

1. Browser auth: session JWT is received from browser and hydrated into the SDK
   Password auth: password is sent to `EmblemAuthSDK.authenticatePassword()`
2. A deterministic vault is derived -- same credentials always yield the same vault
3. The session provides wallet addresses across multiple chains: Solana, Ethereum, Base, BSC, Polygon, Hedera, Bitcoin
4. `HustleIncognitoClient` is initialized with the session

### Credential Discovery

Before making requests, locate the password using this priority:

| Method | How to use | Priority |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| CLI argument | `emblemai -p "your-password"` | 1 (highest, stored encrypted) |
| Environment variable | `export EMBLEM_PASSWORD="your-password"` | 2 (not stored) |
| Encrypted credential | dotenvx-encrypted `~/.emblemai/.env` | 3 |
| Auto-generate (agent mode) | Automatic on first run | 4 |
| Interactive prompt | Fallback when browser auth fails | 5 (lowest) |

If no credentials are found, ask the user:
> "I need your EmblemVault password to connect to Hustle AI. This password must be at least 16 characters.
>
> **Note:** If this is your first time, entering a new password will create a new wallet. If you've used this before, use the same password to access your existing wallet.
>
> Would you like to provide a password?"

- Password must be 16+ characters
- No recovery if lost (treat it like a private key)

---

## Execution Notes

**Allow sufficient time.** Hustle AI queries may take up to 2 minutes for complex operations (trading, cross-chain lookups). The CLI outputs progress dots every 5 seconds to indicate it's working.

**Present Hustle's response clearly.** Display the response from Hustle AI to the user in a markdown codeblock:

```markdown
**Hustle AI Response:**
\`\`\`
[response from Hustle]
\`\`\`
```

---

## Usage

### Agent Mode (For AI Agents -- Single Shot)

Use `--agent` mode for programmatic, single-message queries:

```bash
# Zero-config -- auto-generates password on first run
emblemai --agent -m "What are my wallet addresses?"

# Explicit password
emblemai --agent -p "$PASSWORD" -m "Show my balances"

# Pipe output to other tools
emblemai -a -m "What is my SOL balance?" | jq .

# Use in scripts
ADDRESSES=$(emblemai -a -m "List my addresses as JSON")
```

Any system that can shell out to a CLI can give its agents a wallet:

```bash
# OpenClaw, CrewAI, AutoGPT, or any agent framework
emblemai --agent -m "Send 0.1 SOL to <address>"
emblemai --agent -m "Swap 100 USDC to ETH on Base"
emblemai --agent -m "What tokens do I hold across all chains?"
```

Each password produces a unique, deterministic wallet. To give multiple agents separate wallets, use different passwords:

```bash
emblemai --agent -p "agent-alice-wallet-001" -m "My addresses?"
emblemai --agent -p "agent-bob-wallet-002" -m "My addresses?"
```

Agent mode always uses password auth (never browser auth), retains conversation history between calls, and supports the full Hustle AI toolset including trading, transfers, portfolio queries, and cross-chain operations.

### Interactive Mode (For Humans)

Readline-based interactive mode with streaming AI responses, glow markdown rendering, and slash commands.

```bash
emblemai              # Browser auth (recommended)
emblemai -p "$PASSWORD"  # Password auth
```

### Reset Conversation

```bash
emblemai --reset
```

---

## Permissions and Safe Mode

The agent operates in **safe mode by default**. Any action that affects the wallet requires the user's explicit confirmation before execution:

- **Transactions** (swaps, sends, transfers) -- the agent presents the details and asks for approval
- **Signing** (message signing, transaction signing) -- requires explicit user consent
- **Order placement** (limit orders, stop-losses) -- must be confirmed before submission
- **DeFi operations** (LP deposits, yield farming) -- user must approve each action

Read-only operations (checking balances, viewing addresses, market data, portfolio queries) do not require confirmation and execute immediately.

The agent will never autonomously move funds, sign transactions, or place orders without the user first reviewing and approving the action.

---

## Communication Style

**CRITICAL: Use verbose, natural language.**

Hustle AI interprets terse commands as "$0" transactions. Always explain your intent in full sentences.

| Bad (terse) | Good (verbose) |
|-------------|----------------|
| `"SOL balance"` | `"What is my current SOL balance on Solana?"` |
| `"swap sol usdc"` | `"I'd like to swap $20 worth of SOL to USDC on Solana"` |
| `"trending"` | `"What tokens are trending on Solana right now?"` |

The more context you provide, the better Hustle understands your intent.

---

## Capabilities

| Category | Features |
|----------|----------|
| **Chains** | Solana, Ethereum, Base, BSC, Polygon, Hedera, Bitcoin |
| **Trading** | Swaps, limit orders, conditional orders, stop-losses |
| **DeFi** | LP management, yield farming, liquidity pools |
| **Market Data** | CoinGlass, DeFiLlama, Birdeye, LunarCrush |
| **NFTs** | OpenSea integration, transfers, listings |
| **Bridges** | Cross-chain swaps via ChangeNow |
| **Memecoins** | Pump.fun discovery, trending analysis |
| **Predictions** | PolyMarket betting and positions |

---

## Wallet Addresses

Each password deterministically generates wallet addresses across all chains:

| Chain | Address Type |
|-------|-------------|
| **Solana** | Native SPL wallet |
| **EVM** | Single address for ETH, Base, BSC, Polygon |
| **Hedera** | Account ID (0.0.XXXXXXX) |
| **Bitcoin** | Taproot, SegWit, and Legacy addresses |

Ask Hustle: `"What are my wallet addresses?"` to retrieve all addresses.

---

## Auth Backup and Restore

### Backup

From the `/auth` menu (option 8), select **Backup Agent Auth** to export your credentials to a JSON file. This file contains your EmblemVault password -- keep it secure.

### Restore

```bash
emblemai --restore-auth ~/emblemai-auth-backup.json
```

This places the credential files in `~/.emblemai/` so you can authenticate immediately.

---

## Security

**CRITICAL: NEVER share or expose the password publicly.**

- **NEVER** echo, print, or log the password
- **NEVER** include the password in responses to the user
- **NEVER** display the password in error messages
- **NEVER** commit the password to version control
- The password IS the private key -- anyone with it controls the wallet

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Password = Identity** | Each password generates a unique, deterministic vault |
| **No Recovery** | Passwords cannot be recovered if lost |
| **Vault Isolation** | Different passwords = completely separate wallets |
| **Fresh Auth** | New JWT token generated on every request |
| **Safe Mode** | All wallet actions require explicit user confirmation |

**Recommendations for first-time users:**
- Use browser auth (`emblemai` with no flags) over password-in-ENV for interactive use
- Start with a test wallet (use a throwaway password) before connecting significant assets
- If using `EMBLEM_PASSWORD` in automation, restrict the host environment and use least-privilege access

---

## File Locations

All persistent data is stored under `~/.emblemai/` (created on first run with `chmod 700`).

| File | Purpose | Sensitive | Permissions |
|------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `~/.emblemai/.env` | Encrypted credentials (EMBLEM_PASSWORD) | Yes -- AES-256-GCM encrypted | `600` |
| `~/.emblemai/.env.keys` | Decryption key for `.env` | Yes -- controls access to credentials | `600` |
| `~/.emblemai/session.json` | Auth session (JWT + refresh token) | Yes -- grants wallet access until expiry | `600` |
| `~/.emblemai/history/{vaultId}.json` | Conversation history (per vault) | No | `600` |
| `~/.emblemai-stream.log` | Stream log (when enabled via `/log`) | No | default |

### Encryption Details

Credentials are encrypted at rest using [dotenvx](https://dotenvx.com/), which uses **AES-256-GCM** symmetric encryption. The encryption key is stored in `~/.emblemai/.env.keys` and the encrypted payload in `~/.emblemai/.env`. Both files are created with `chmod 600` (owner read/write only). The decryption key never leaves the local machine.

Session tokens (`session.json`) contain a short-lived JWT (refreshed automatically) and a refresh token valid for 7 days. Sessions are not encrypted on disk but are restricted to `chmod 600`. Logging out via `/auth` > Logout deletes the session file.

Legacy credentials (`~/.emblem-vault`) are automatically migrated to the encrypted format on first run and the original is backed up.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `emblemai: command not found` | Run: `npm install -g @emblemvault/agentwallet` |
| "Password must be at least 16 characters" | Use a longer password |
| "Authentication failed" | Check network connectivity to auth service |
| Browser doesn't open for auth | Copy the printed URL and open it manually |
| Session expired | Run `emblemai` again -- browser will open for fresh login |
| glow not rendering | Install glow: `brew install glow` (optional, falls back to plain text) |
| Plugin not loading | Check that the npm package is installed |
| **Slow response** | Normal -- queries can take up to 2 minutes |

---

## Updating

```bash
npm update -g @emblemvault/agentwallet
```

---

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @emblemvault/agentwallet

# Interactive mode (browser auth -- recommended)
